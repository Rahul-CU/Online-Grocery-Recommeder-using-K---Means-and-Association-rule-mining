# Online-Grocery-Recommeder-using-K---Means-and-Association-rule-mining
Product recommendations can take many forms in the ecommerce shopping experience: they can be used to recommend other products on a product's page (for example, Amazon's "Frequently bought together" feature) or they can be used on the checkout page to show customers products that they might be interested in based on their total order. In this project, I'll show you how to use a grocery recommender in the first scenario.
Furthermore, rather than being provided uniformly, recommendations may be more useful if they are targeted at a certain section of clients. For example, if one group of customers buys a lot of nondairy milk alternatives while another group buys regular milk, it might make sense to give various suggestions for that box of Cheerios. 
To develop customized recommendations, I used K-Means clustering to classify Instacart users based on their purchase history, and then created recommenders based on product association rules within those clusters. In this project, I will describe the process and provide an online grocery recommender system, along with its implementation and the machine learning techniques that were used to predict and recommend grocery goods that the user would like.
